# GoScaffold, there are no excuses to start in GO

A minimal project structure generator to begin to programming on Golang quickly

## Golang, what it that?
Start here [Golang Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)

## Why do I need a generator?
It is a convenient way to have a starting point for all your projects, so that all your projects start with the same dependencies and the same architecture

## Usage  

```sh
go get -u github.com/aperezg/goscaffold/cmd/goscaffold
```

To see how to use the tool and the available commands:
```sh
goscaffold -h
```

## WIP
This project is under construction and may contain bugs

Options not implemented yet:
* gitlabci
* docker
